### Machine Learning

So lets talk about machine learning. When i say machine learning other people may associate it with artificial intelligence but to be more precise i will be using the term machine learning which is a subclass of artificial intelligence. In particular deep learning oriented architectures proved to very effective in solving problems like speech recognition, image classification and so! many other tasks that nowadays really everyone who's working in this field is using techniques from this field. Without going into detail on why this has happened i will start with a very advanced technique called **Transformer**. I know you might think this could be too advanced but i will start from scratch here and i am living up to the claim that at the end of this post you are not only able to program a model, train it and do inferencing (fancy for applying a model and make predictions) but also follow along on a piece of paper. Yes, i will do one full computation for training and inferencing by hand.
