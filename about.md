## About Me

My Name is Frederik Elischberger, i currently live in Germany, Munich and doing my PhD in a topic related to Machine Learning. My Motivation for starting this Blog was triggered by the urge of sharing information. It always fascinated me that there exists so many really good Blogs especially about Machine Learning related topics. My first approach when tackling a new topic in this area is to find someone writing about it in a Blog which most of the time someone did and proved to be a very effective step for learning. I hope someone out there will experience something similar with this Blog and if so you is very welcome to share that information with me.
