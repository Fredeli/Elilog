## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Fredeli/Elilog/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Test Formula

You can use $$\LaTeX$$ to typeset formulas. A formula can be displayed inline, e.g. $$e=mc^2$$, or as a block:
$$\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v~dx = \int_\Omega fv~dx$$
Also check out this [LaTeX introduction](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Fredeli/Elilog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
